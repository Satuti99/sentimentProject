# Tweet Your Sentiments: A Streamlit-Powered Python Web App for Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Create the Streamlit web application: Design the user interface to display sentiment analysis results.
Visualize the results: Use charts or graphs to present sentiment distribution and trends over time.

Save results to CSV: Append the sentiment values to the Twitter data CSV file.

Test the application: Validate the functionality and user experience of the web app.


Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Streamlit enables us to gain valuable insights into public opinions and emotions related to specific topics on Twitter. By building an interactive web application, we can efficiently visualize and analyze the sentiment distribution. This project provides a practical example of using NLP, machine learning, and web development tools to extract meaningful information from social media data.


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run deploy
```


## Roadmap

Step 1: Install Streamlit and other required libraries.
Step 2: Create a Twitter Developer account and generate API keys.
Step 3: Write Python code to authenticate with the Twitter API and extract tweets.
Step 4: Preprocess the tweets by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs.
Step 5: Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to assign sentiment scores to each tweet.
Step 6: Store the data in a CSV file for easy access and manipulation.
Step 7: Use Streamlit to create a web app that allows users to input a keyword and see the sentiment analysis results in real-time.
Step 8: Deploy the web app to a hosting platform such as AWS.
